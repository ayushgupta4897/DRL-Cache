2. **Online Learning**: Develop adaptive training during cache operation  
3. **Hardware Optimization**: Explore inference acceleration techniques
4. **Extended Evaluation**: Include more diverse workloads and cache configurations

## Conclusion

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that DRL Cache represents a promising approach to cache eviction optimization. While the current implementation with a mock model shows competitive but not superior performance, the framework provides a solid foundation for advanced machine learning approaches to cache management.

The systematic benchmarking framework developed for this evaluation provides a valuable tool for future cache policy research and can support reproducible comparisons across different approaches.
