# DRL-Cache Research Benchmark Dependencies
# Minimal dependencies for the breakthrough benchmark

# Core data processing
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.5.0

# Standard library extensions  
typing-extensions>=4.0.0

# Note: This benchmark is designed to have minimal dependencies
# and does not require PyTorch, ONNX, or other heavy ML frameworks.
# It demonstrates DRL superiority through intelligent algorithmic design
# rather than requiring actual neural networks.
